Gaussian Point Source Plume Dispersion Model
- Calculate C(x,y,z) pollutant concentration as a function of downwind position (x,y,z)
- Equation - Plume with reflection of pollutant from the ground for stack height H.
- σz (vertical dispersion coefficient) and σy (horizontal dispersion coefficient) are functions of x downwind distance from the source.
